TSNLOCAL_ADDR
>>>now it is clear to me how authen addresses are obtained. Now the biggest problems is how TSNLOCAL adress is read  out.

it is carried out by
GetAddress(TSNLOCAL_ADDR)  //in GetTsnLocalAddr()

NOW let's make clear of the whole process, what is happening in GetAddress():
1. AddrConfigFileRead() is called first.


m_clsAddrConfig->Read(AUTHEN_CLIENT_ADDR_PATH)

2. MainConfigFileRead()
 
 m_strSelectedValue=m_clsMainConfig->GetOption("main","selected");  //here the value is RF obviously---peter

3.  strAddress=m_clsAddrConfig->GetOption( g_arrayTagName[Classify],m_strSelectedValue);

Now we know which file is being read (axtu-authen-client-addr.conf), and RF is selected here.


now if Classify==TSNLOCAL_ADDR,

REGISTER_ADDR


There is something buggy here:

/**********************************************
Not yet implement for transmission the Profile
const string g_arrayTagName[nSectionMax]={"AuthenticationServer","SignUp","TsnLocal"};
**********************************************/


>>> now what happens

 if(Classify == AUTHEN_ADDR)

1. RelayConfigFileReadAndCheck()


m_clsRelayConfig->Read(RELAY_CONF_PATH)

#define RELAY_CONF_PATH        "/etc/axtu-authen-client/relay.conf"

but the conf file does not exsits!!!

NOTE: I believe AUTHEN_ADDR shall be releplace by TSNLOCAL_ADDR here.
What is in relay.conf shall be tsnlocal adr, and the authen adr is already in /var/axtu/axtu-authen-client.conf
BUG, undoubtly!

the thing is that GetTsnLocalAddr(void) is never called by the hight level functions.
and GetAddress() shows up nowhere else, it is called in GetAuth...(), which are used in high level places.
