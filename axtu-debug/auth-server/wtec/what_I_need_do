What I need to do

1. add WT product key to DB->register_info->asianux key
//see CheckProductNumber($product_number) to know why

2. I will first use RF rpm repo url for WT, this is the last step of authentication, so it does not matter
urls are in connect info,
but I need not to add WT here. just change "update.redflag.com" to "peter.wt.com"
