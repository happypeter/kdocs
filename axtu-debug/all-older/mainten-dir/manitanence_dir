SDS495****axtu-1.4.16-1AX--------------this is the one we want to do maintenance on.

* Now Let's talk about 1.4/
since we already 4AX, but we want do maint on 1AX, so we have a 5AX which is same as 1AX, and do mt on 5AX

* Now Let's talk about 1.5/

>>>what to do
1. sent a new package 1.5
2. no need to change comps/
3. change VERMAP
  . when my new package is approved VERMAP will be changed automatically, but we still need to manually do sth like
  . "dbmail:BP:3.0-maint:2.2.5:ia32,x86_64,ia64,pp" to it-----Huajie did it for me
4.  cd /project/distfiles/axtu/1.5/----------------svn usually only keep patches, but axtu is special
5. change the obselete tag patch name form 1.4 to 1.5
6. remove all .svn/ in 1.4 then copy all the file to 1.5
7. change SPEC of all versions.
>>>Question
