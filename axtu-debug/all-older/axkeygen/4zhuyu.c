Zhuyu said 250 needs axkeygen and axkeychk to be a really clone of 155.
It is true 155 has both.
without axkeychk, you will not be able to use productkey if you delete it in 155 db.

>>>
1. cd libaxkey/
make&&make install
2.  cd axkeychk/
make&&make install
3.  cd axkeygen/
make&&make install
4. 
mkdir -p /etc/axkey/
mv axkey.conf /etc/axkey/
5. done
