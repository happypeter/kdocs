Epoch debug

>>>GetFullPathFile()
shows up in ./axtu/gui/classGUI.cpp
defined in rpmEngine.cpp
Note the argument bHeader, then we know axtu does not take epoch into consideration

>>CompareHeaderInfo()   //in rpmengine.cpp
it has nothing to do with epoch


>>>Now the comparision process is clear,
1. in axtu/gui/axtu/main.cpp, we see
<code>
        rpmEngine->ReadRemoteHeaderInfo();
        rpmEngine->ReadLocalHeaderInfo();
        rpmEngine->CreateUpdateInstallList();
</code>

2. so obviously the comparison is done in
rpmEngine->CreateUpdateInstallList();

3. Now in CreateUpdateInstallList();

when  bFind = true&&nCompare>0, the romote package will be added to updatelist

4. Now all we need to do is to add sth like
if(strEpochR>strEpochL)
before
nCompare = CompareVerRel(strVerR, strRelR, strVerL, strRelL);


>>>we need to compare
itRemote->strEpoch               //this vaule is just what I want
and
itLocal->strEpoch                 //this one is always ""---?

the reason is below:
<reason>
headerInfo.strEpoch.assign(strTemp, 0, index1);-----------assign sth valid in remote
headerInfo.strEpoch = strTemp;------------------------------------assign sth empty in local
</reason>

that's because headerNEVRA() fail to readout sth for &ep  (epoch pointer), which is hard to believe.
headerNEVEA() is defined in INCLUDE/rpmlib.h, in which I see
@unused@ before * ep
haha, so headerNEVRA can not do what I want, I need another function to read my local epoch out!!!
I think I can add my ep-reading function just below headerNEVEA(), that way I do not need to change the structure a lot
so that I can still use itLocal->

Now my problem seems to be simple, I have hdr, and I want my epoch out of it.

>>>so I find that headerNEVRA is defined in rpm-4.4.2/lib/rpmdb/hdrNVR.c   (Note: it is rpm itself now, not part of axtu)
in which I find headerGetEntry() is used to read out
name-----version-----release.
but if you pass to similar args trying to get epoch, it simply won't work.
but in ./lib/psm.c, I see the rignt way to read epoch from a hdr.

>>>so I use headerGetEntry() the right way to get epoch successfully with rpmengine.
Now the problem is how to let itLocal and itRemote point to the packages with same name.
