Description From Vit Pelcak 2009-04-07 00:19:37 MDT (-)

It would be nice if yast2 sw_single was able to offer more option to handle
obsolete packages.

Now user typically has to display installed packages and pass through the list,
manually select obsolete packages one by one and select action to perform.

It would be cool if there was option to display obsolete packages in
Installation summary. Together with feature which would allow multiple packages
selection, that would ease handling of those packages.

It would be also nice, if there was option in menu that would trigger automatic
obsolete package handling. Then would be obsoleted packages replaced by
available version or deleted.
