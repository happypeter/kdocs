Hello Xue Hong,

I have a questoin about axtu and tsn.

Which port are used for the communication with axtu in the TSN server.
I think it is using 80(http) and 443(https) for authentication and 20,21(ftp) for
 transferring the packages.Is this correct?
Could you please let me know all numbers of the ports ?

best resgads,
Miyashita
