Hello Xue Hong,

I have a questoin about axtu and tsn.

Which port are used for the communication with axtu in the TSN server.
I think it is using 80(http) and 443(https) for authentication and 20,21(ftp) for
 transferring the packages.Is this correct?
Could you please let me know all numbers of the ports ?

best resgads,
Miyashita

Hi Miyashita san,

  443 for authentication is right,
  I don't think pkg get by ftp, it should use wget by 80port.

  I am not developer of axtu, maybe Peter could correct me if i am wrong.
Anyway, TSN local open 443 and 80 port for the client connect.

  Peter, how do you think about this issue?

regards,
