AXTU-Authen Tailand debug

1. when I enter puduct key, the QLineEdit widget sent it to
ProductNumberInputed( const QString & )


2. then through
COMPANY classChecker::CheckProductNumber(string strPN)
we get a return value of HS or RF or sth.

3. then the return COMPANY is stored in cn and used in
m_clsConfigCtrl->SetAuthenCompany(cn);

what you do here is actually
SaveCompanyNameToConfFile(companyCode)

in which you add "selected=RF" in
AUTHEN_CLIENT_CONF_PATH = "/var/axtu/axtu-authen-client.conf"

4. Now someone will read the conf file out for later use.  It is
m_clsAddrConfig->Read(AUTHEN_CLIENT_ADDR_PATH)
it is called in./libs/classConfigCtrl.cpp
 classConfigCtrl::AddrConfigFileRead(void), so the function will know it should readout the url for RF
it is called by
string classConfigCtrl::GetAddress(ADDR_TYPE Classify)
when
Classify=AUTHEN_ADDR;
the adress is readout by this
strAddress=GetRelayAddr()
then the addr in
AUTHEN_CLIENT_ADDR_PATH = "/usr/share/axtu-authen-client/.conf/axtu-authen-client-addr.conf";
is read out
//so we surely need to add Tailand addr here
>>> actually all the above operation only require the first bit of the product number(see classChecker)
the other bits is sent to remote server for later use



>>>>>>>About Setup<<<<<<<<<

>>>when axtu setup start for the first time, the server list is read from /etc/axtu/axtu.conf, you can make a stupid change here.,
but once you enter the product key and user name and passwd, your stupid change will gone.
that means, it is the product key that is leading the way, Not the config file.

>>>now to me, it goes this way: the setup UI does read things form /etc/axtu/axtu.conf, but when you connect remote server successfully, axtu.conf can be changed some way.
But the change is not carried out by axtu setup, it must be done by axtu-authen-client. That means I need not change the setup source code.
