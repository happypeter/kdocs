<pre>
if I click axtu -U 
firrst I see 

"Verifying Header files integrity...", it takes long time, so I suspect if hdr anylysis is done here
but the following serch result prove my prediction wrong, and it is nothing but downloading
<>
if(ds == DS_DOWN){
                        strDownloadLabel="Downloading Header files....";
                }else if(ds == DS_CHECK){
                        strDownloadLabel="Verifying Header files integrity....";
                }else{
                        strDownloadLabel="Unknown state";
                }
</>

<wget>
typedef enum{
        DS_DOWN = 1,
        DS_CHECK
} DOWNLOAD_STATE;
</>

>>>as a test I delete everything in /var/cache/axtu/, then axtu -U again
now it take 100 times longer when "Downloading hdr ..."
and also 100 times less time "Verifying Header files integrity..."

then "Reading header informaintion..."-----it is done in ReadHeaders()


Q.how TestRpmEngine() get executed, since I can not find the call for it???
A: it is simply never used, haha.

so there is no steps you can see in main.cpp, but it has this 
<>
        gui = new classGui(nMode);
        gui->show();
        app->setMainWidget(gui);
</>
so details are in classGui.
>>>now let's see classGui.cpp
NOTE: when axtu first start it is lancher that get executed, you click one button here
or issue $axtu -u
then axtu/classGui is generated.
and
classGui::classGui(int nMode)
is aumatically executed.
<>
    <connection>
        <sender>btnNext</sender>
        <signal>clicked()</signal>
        <receiver>MainDialog</receiver>
        <slot>slotNext()</slot>
    </connection>
<>
so if we click "Next<<" let's see what will happen
1.
void classGui::slotNext()
{
        MoveNextPage();
}
2.
InitRpm()->ShowList()-----------all my step questions have their answers here
