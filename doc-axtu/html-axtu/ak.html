AK

<<< now we are going to find out what is actually happening to AK.
1. in gui/main.cpp
 g_pclsFileCtl = new classFileCtl(g_szAF,g_szTF);
 strAk=g_pclsFileCtl->GetAuthenKey();

2. Now in GetAuthenKey();
  we know AK is read from :
 AUTHEN_FILE_PATH    =    "/var/axtu";
 AUTHEN_FILE_NAME    =    "asianux-auth";

3. so where is the number in asianux-auth from?
it is from remote side.

4.
 
The following words are from axtu flow chart,
<pre> 
   For registration : ID, PassWord, Product Key
               HW hash value are sent.
To access for updating : AK, HW Hash value are sent.
</pre>
Which means AK is read form remote side, form auth server
Q: Does axtu call auth_client again, even the right ak is still there?
For now I believe the answer is yes, since axtu itslef only sent AK&&TK to the sever side
the following code is in the constuctor of " ./gui/axtu/classGui.cpp"

/*
        if(m_nMode != ERASE_MODE)
        {
                int nResult = m_Network->CheckAuthen();

*/
"systerm("axtu-auth-client")" is called uncondtionally in 'CheckAuthen()',
so whenever axtu starts, auth-client is always called.


>>>when authen program start, first it will make clear it is Register mode or access mode,
if(auth)
{
read AK from local
}
else
{
creat AK in remote and read
}

>>>in v_1_0.php , the server actually the the following things to AK

1.$authen_key=trim($_POST['ak']);
//receive ak from client

2.if( (strlen($authen_key) == 0) && (strlen($product_number) != 0)){
 //if client AK does not esist, go to register




</pre>
