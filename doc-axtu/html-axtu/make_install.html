bug: when I debug libs/, every time I am done, I can simply run make install and test it.
but gui/ stuff simply can not be updated by make install, no matter you run command in top dir or sub dir.

FIX: so seems done by rpm, can check the SPEC

NOTE: now I am not sure if the above is right,
there is a story about this. so on the svn repo there is actually a final binary under gui/setup/
just now I found it and considered it dirty, so I git remove it, and commit this into my own git repo
then something strange happens.
so under gui/setup/, I run make, then there is no binary found anymore.
the changed binary is in /usr/share/axtu/gui/
there is even no need to run "make install"
I consider the reason like this,
so someone commit the binary into svn repo,
then next time I check it out, then run ./configure
since there is sth dirty there, the Makefile therefore generated is buggy.
Anyway, now the binary is removed and everything actually works as it should again.
