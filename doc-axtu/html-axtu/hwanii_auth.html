<pre>
one thing hwanii menationed is interesting,
he said auth_mysql wants AK and TK to unlock the repo.
that's why we believe unauthorized user can not use TSN to download packages.
but if auth-client is open source, then people can hack down to find out how the
hardware hash can all other local info is generated, save them, use them one another machine
to cheat auth_mysql this machine is also authorized. That's possible, I think.
