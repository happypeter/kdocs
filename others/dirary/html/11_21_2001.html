<h3>11_21_2001 One word frees us</h3>

<p>of all the weight and pain of life: that word is love</p>

<p>
Even love untrturned has its rainbow.
</p>
<p>
Once I let a true love slip away before my eyes, only to find myself regetting when is was two late. Nothing
in the world can be as painful as this. Just let your sword cut into my throat! Do not hesitate!
If God will give me another chance. I would tell the gril I love her. If our love had to have a time limit. 
I wish it would be 10,000 years.

When you sit with a nice gril for 2 hours, you think it's only a minite. But when you sit on a hot stove for a 
minite you think it is 2 hours. That's relativity.----Albert Einstein

<p>
What is language for? Some people seem to think it's for practising grammar rules and learning lists of words.
The longer the words the better. That's wrong. Language is for the exchange of ideas, for communication.
</p>
<p>
People who are not in love fail to understand how a intellegent man can suffer because of a very ordinary woman.
