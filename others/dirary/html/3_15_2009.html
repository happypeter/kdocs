My Dear Friend,
</p>
<p>
This letter is a reminder of our friendship. I am now in Beijing working for Asianux Ltd. I am busy and happy but I realize true friends are so hard to get.
Even in a city loaded with more than 10 million people, loneliness is hardly uncommon, which makes old days friends so precious to me.

In the attached file you will find my resume and some of my photos. I hope these things can bring me near to you and I am in great hunger of getting something likewise from you.

</p>
<p>
Keep in touch. May your days be filled with love and joy.
</p>

Love
Peter
