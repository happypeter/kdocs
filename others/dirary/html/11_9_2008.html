<h3>  Dream as a Coder </h3>


	
	<p>   Yesterday evening, I read The C
Programming Languange by R&amp;K and was shocked by how elegent they
are in their book  
last night, I has a dream, in which I was
asked to give a speech in front of all my classmates. My topic is
open soureeven though I knew no one here knew open
source. But I did not care and went on ahead with the topic I loved,
and peoplewere obviously confused by all the
concepts they had never heard of. Thus by and by I myself felt a
little embarassed but 
was determined to finish my speech driven
my passion.Just like that, I finished my speech and felt not so sure
about the result.
To my suprise, all my friends cheers and
said Hi Peter you did a good job. I even hear one guy shout out hi
Peter you are a real hacker.
</p>
<p> 
I could not be happier, not even on my
face
but also in the buttom of my heart.When I got up this morning, I saw
beautiful sunshine, what a wonderful day!I will need to continue my hunting for a
job, and now I know what I really love and want.Hold fast to your dreams!</p>
