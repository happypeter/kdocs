<h3>Quadcopter meeting at Yu chi restraurant</h3>
<P>I met Xuedi, Ollo, and another two chinese guys.
For more than two hour, we were talking in perfect harmony,
everybody was so friendly.They showed me two AVR board talking to each other.</FONT></P>
<P> I asked what software under ubuntu could I use to edit web page 
without knowing the html language in detail.
Semel (one of the Chinese guy) told me
that bluefish might be what I want.</P>
<P>I left them at 9:30 pm to catch the
subway.I need to say I love the meeting, and
enjoy the talking with these guys very much!
