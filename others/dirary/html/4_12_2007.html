<h3>  Start ARM </h3>

<P>  Most folks are about as happy as they make up their minds to be. ------Abraham Lincoln    
So now is the time for me to be a happy man. Otherwise I will grow old a useless man.   </P>

<P>  On ARM study: It is more useful to cut off one of his finger than to injure ten.
 So what I need now is a clear aim, a clear shedule and solid work.
To be more specific:


</P>





<OL>
	<LI> Try to understand ARM architecture by reading books. Better to use one book than to wonder around many
						The foundamentals shall be read 100 times, while the specifics one or two. 
						All in all, try to concentrate on the basics  
	<LI> Buy expentment board, then learn how to use the corresponding software.
						Since these tasks need to be carry out on Internet, which may reduce my reading time, so there is no rush. 
	<LI>Considering Kongfu all over the world, no one becomes unbeatable because it is exteremely strong.
						Only the fastest ones are unbeatable. Therefore what I really value is not what I learn but how fast i learn
						To achieve this, I need a strong rail way, so that the train will be able to run fast on it. 
						The railway is my strict shedule, simple but pratcical  
	<LI> My plan now is to study nothing but ARM. With my love for MCU, I believe I can do it. 
						Once the aim is fixed, I shall be able to run fast now, otherwise I will get lost within too many tasks   
</OL>

<h3>My shedule now is as follows</h3>
<OL>
	<LI>8:00~11:00 am-------------reading books 
	<LI> 2:30~5:00 pm -------------practice computer skills
	<LI>6:00~10:30 pm -------------reading books    
	<LI>joging every three days 
	<LI> Nothing in life is to be feared, only to be understood
</OL>

<P> One thing to be corrected: I have been messy recently. Many unworthy things was done, only to make myself exahusted.
<br>Think about my third year college life, My life was quite simple, but my heart was free. To learn from this experience, I shall concentrate on my major, 
<br>If I really want to be joyful. The boat of life won't be able to carry too much.
 </P>
