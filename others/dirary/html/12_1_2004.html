<h3>12_1_2004 We can not choose We just experience</h3>
<p>
I have been staying in this world for more than 21 years. The path of my life is not choosen but given, that's how I feel.
Just like a passenger behind a train window, I passed mountian and valley watching the cloud on the sky, nothing I can do 
but to give a smile or sigh. Whatever happens outside the window, we can not change or foresee.

I believe my life came from the top of a snow mountain, sunshine made it active,  then a sand of snow became a drop of water.
First a little spring then truned into a big river.

Thereafter, from the beginning to the end, we never choose. We just pass hills and lakes, happiness and pain, love and suffering.
That way, when our soul is waken up, our heart is made clean, we are then part of infinite ocean. We are thus far from narrowness, loneliness
and we have forever joy.
