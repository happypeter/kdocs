<p>Ladies and gentlemen,</p>
<p>
Today is truly a memorable occasion, for it is Mr Wang's 22th Birthday. On behalf of
everyone present here today to clelebrate this occasion, I want to congratulate hom most heartily, and wish him many many
happy returns of this day. I hope as you all do, that Mr Wang will be able to see day when the candles on his birthday cake
will prove more expensive thanthe cake itself.
