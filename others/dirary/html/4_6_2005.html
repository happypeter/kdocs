<h3>  My Precious Love   </h3>

True love is more wanting her to be happy than owning her, it is pure and selfishless.
Love is fire, not a burning desire but a torch giving warmness and light. Love is clear
spring, but not the running water that kills all its time chasing the falling peach flower
It is for washing away the red dust of life and giving peace and freedom back to human hearts.
