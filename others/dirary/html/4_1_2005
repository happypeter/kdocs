A Feeling to Tell

Now ,for the time being when all will come to a end .I can not stop the eagerness to tell the simple fact that ,for you, I have a feeling hidden in the bottom of my heart , I dare not say it is love ,but it is certainly strong.

    The feeling is strong ,even though you do not have such a feeling for me ,the feeling is strong regardless the love of you is in fact for a other guy.

The feeling will not end ,after I know you own your joyful marriage. The feeling will not vanish ,after I meet my own sweet heart.

I just want to say that no matter how things  will change ,whatever will happen ,you will ,in my heart ,still be that lovely ,happy ,beautiful gril with wonderful wonderful smile and long long hair.

    I can not deny that time can take away every thing ,good or bad, valuable or worthless .But when it comes to my feeling for you ,I believe it will take long ,maybe longer than the rest of my life which will last merely several decades . I do believe after my death I can be infinite ,I can live at any time when I was happy during this life ,so then I get the chance to care you more ,more than I had ,cherishing every second we spent and will spend together. 

     If God will give me another chance ,I would prefer not to meet you . maybe you think that I have a joy at this time . but you  really don’t  know  me .It is true that I am not happy .I don’t want to hurt anybody ,especially you. If I can’t bring any happy to the one who is good for me ,I would like not to stay with him. I don’t want anyone sad because of me .It is a good luck for me to know you .Please promise me to regard me as a common friend ,ok ?I  think your girlfriend will be a beautiful and excellent girl ,she must be the happiest girl in the world.

    If love is unreturned ,please give up it !
