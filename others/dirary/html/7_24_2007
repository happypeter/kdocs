Hi Peter
 
I have been very bad about keeping contact with my friends in China. Sorry about that.
 
But here I am now. I am working in a government school in Hscinchu about 2 hours from Taipei. Teaching here is very different to teaching in China. The Taiwanese government pay us high salaries and take good care of us foreigners.
 
I am missing my friends and the Chinese culture very much and am hoping to come on holiday to China during the Chinese new year.
 
I hope all is well wit U and that your studies are going well.
 
Looking forward to hearing from you.
 
Regards
Roy
