<h3>  3_6_2009 Forgiveness </h3>
<pre>
Forgiveness is the answer to the child's dream 
of a miracle by which what is broken is made whole again,
what is soiled is again made clean.

Days ago, when my grandma was about to die. She bitterly cursed her daughter-in-laws for treating her badly.
What I did then is holding her hands and saying forgiveness. Cause I belive the world would lose its hope without
this noble deed.
</p>
<p>
During the past two weeks, I saw the dark side of human beings myself. I having been fighting with mad dogs for too long.
And I am tired. Will I forgive Heqing? Will I be noble myself?
</p>
<p>I will not bring somebody else pain because I am suffering, I will try to love those who hate me, I will say love and care when I leave this world.

And this is my oath!</p>
