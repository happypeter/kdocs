<h3>Love GNU</h3>

<p>This evening, I did not feel good about my career and my future.
I want to be great but how? What can i do? Artist? musician? poet?
Those ideas won't work. For one thing I am not talented that way,
for another, I can not make a living that way.</p>
<p>Is there anything I can do which brings me money and fills my soul
at same time?</p>
<p>Well, Seems difficult but the answer is right there when I am here
<p>www.gnu.org</p>
<p>
what I see are wonderful ideas here.
Free software that makes my life as free as software...
Hacker culture that attract me, can not wait to be a hacker...
I can read in English, I am offered a chance to express myself.
All my talents is now in use to bring me fresh air of life
All i do everyday is now communicate with smart and great people?
No more rude stupid bosses ! The big ocean of knowledge is now here to help me
develop myself....</p>

<p>I want my own personal website
learn more coding skills
do accord to 'How to became a hacker'
</p>
