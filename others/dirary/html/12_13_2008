12_13_2008-----openmoko
This morning, I read why openmoko is best?
http://wiki.openmoko.org/wiki/Why_Openmoko
and learnt a lot
To me openmoko programming means:
1. my knoweledge on embedded filed won't be wasted
2. easy to move to PC platform as they say "openmoko development...all linux programmers will feel at home "
3. more importantly, it  open and free

So as soon as I have time, I will do something more about openmoko.
But one most important questions remains:
where shall i go first? kernel space or user space?
With my background knoweledge, I shall be better off to continue my journey in the kernel.
However user space programming also tempts me. So if I get a offer for user app programming,
I will not reject.
