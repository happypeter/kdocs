On taking notes

This evening, I changed 'doc_12_11_2008' into 'note_12_11_2008'.

And I deleted the whole directory 'lenovo', what a pity!

But I have to because all the articles is closely related to cixtone,

now I do not have cixtone in my hand, that means all the things in these articles are of no use.

Even I bought a cixtone in the future, I do not likely code for it, the reason is simple, it is not open enough.

So this teaches me a good lessonâ€”never spent too much time on a project that you can not continue!

On taking notes, I will in the future divide my notes into two type:

a) study note

b) project note

What is study note ?

Study notes contains notes for commonly used tools, like

   1. programming languages
   2. CVS, SVN,
   3. distro usage like unbuntu tips suse tips
   4. and everything related to a single big thing

What is project note ?

Project notes are basically taken when I want to make something, notes of this kind are quite environment dependent,

with many tools being in use all at the same time. Like

   1. notes on Cixtone
   2. notes on my Tinylion
   3. debug 2410_ad
   4. qte development environment setup

Project notes are in fact the majority in my note tree.

Notes for Cixtone are almost of no use now.

Tinylion notes shall be converted into project doc, since Tinylion is a big enough project.

Tinylion notes worth the time and effort, because my future project can besed on Tinylion
I have everything needed.

Notes on ad debug shall be converted into project doc as well, eve though ad_debug project is small.

The others...well.. I can not say for sure, but everything shall be clear.
