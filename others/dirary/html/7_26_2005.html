<h3>7_26_2005 looking back on my four year college life</h3>
<p>
<i>Your cusin said if you did not pay that much attention to that many stupid things, you shall now be a graduate student already...</i> mum told me that day. In her eyes
all my effort has been taken away by my stupidness, that is why I am loser now. Well, I actually do not see it that way.

</p>
<p>
I myself have been staying in this world for long enough so that I believe I know what is life which must have its ups and downs. My primary school joy brought me
the junior middle school feeling of lose, but the effort that time again took me to the heaven of my fist high school year. Thus the wheel kept running, I was then put
in the coldest winter of my life, and the winter last form 1999~2000, almost two years! When it comes to my college life, it is basiclly joyful, exciting, fruitful and all in all sucessful. Of course, what I got varied form one term to another.
</p>
<p>

My freshman and sophomore years were mostly loaded with hard work, but what I obtained form learning English was a big joy. 
The first term me as a junior was in my memory kind of dull, I stopped learning English(but I still got the highest mark in CET-6, that was natrual),
I studied hard still but maily on EE related courses. I failed in my<i> principle  of  automatic  control</i> exam, which made me upset. Therefore
that term was considered as the darkest part of my college life, though it was not too bad. I did not worry, my heart was very peaceful then. Before that, my 
plan to study aborad was put aside, my trip to Changshai too ended up with a awful failure. My heart was cooled down and I didnot has that many hopes and 
I finally calmed down. Being calm down that way fined proved to be more powerful then being passonate. The silence of winter gave birth to a real vivid spring.
When a period of true peace ended, the success came natrully.

<p>
I was a winer during the early half of 2004, though people around me might not consider a funny guy sleeping only 5 hours a day and busying with fuck all a winer.
But as a matter of fact, what I obtained form learning was huge, especially MCS-51 and X86 ASM languages learning as well as <i>Electromagnetics</i>. Of course I am not 
foolish, and what attracted me was not the painful work time. What was really of lots of charm was being chased by lots of classmates with lots of WHYs and Hows.
I slept little but was full of energy, I learned a lot and another shinning point was that I was not lonely during the process. It was the long long hair of JXT that truned
the class room a beautiful graden. And her smell was truly able to bring me more inspiration and power.

</p>

<p> That's just like the old saying goes: Misfortune might be a blessing in disguises. All the good things came to me because of me long time hard working, suffering, 
calming and loneliness. All the bad things I endured built up my castle of perfect success---the passion for work, the big fruit of study, the praise of some friends and the
approches of grils.
</p>
<p>
My senior year was my year of first love, while for some of my classmates it was the year of harvest. God play a little trick with me, and hide away the gift he should give me to honor my long years of hard work, whereas instead he gave me another. But even now, when all was gone with wind, I still want to say: Thanks God! 
</p>  
<p>
I eager for honor, but I do not want to spent all my days in vain glory, I hate disgrace, but somethings it is disgrace that keep me energetic and calm. Any way
I do not want a life that everything goes smoothly, that's  Philistinism. I want a differnt way, I want more happiness yet do not deny nore tear drops. Honor of disgrace,
as long as it bring me passion, is welcomed. Thinking that way, God have given everything I want in my four year college life. I lived my life my own way. Someone lagugh at 
my failures, but he who does nothing but laguhing at others mistakes is a pity, for he will never know the real taste life.
