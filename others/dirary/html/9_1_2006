MY PLAN FOR MY GRADUATE SCHOOL STUDY

Looking back on all my college life ,I feel I am a boy who love study very much .To me noting is more important than the acquisition of knowledge .So when it comes to my plan for my near future, to continue my study seems to be the best choice .

Since no one can deny that the higher education in developed countries is far more advanced ,I hold studying abroad is a aim that worth fighting for. For the time being ,I am sitting for TOEFL test, and if everything goes on very well, GRE is the next step. Even though some people consider GRE to be a nightmare ,I believe it is a wonderful experience of word power enrichment. Anyway language is the expression of  wisedom  accumulated ,as long as we are  bathed in the rich golden light of culture , we will be satisfied and happy, aren’t we ? What if you can not get a offer? What is your alternative? You may ask. I know in life ,as the old saying goes “It is not what you want but what you get”,man can not always get what he wants. Then it is also fine to join a domestic university. 

We all live in a world of gets and losts, people should follow their passion rather than calculation and show the best of us to the rest of the world, just as Doctor king put it : Hew out the mountain of despair a stone of hope .
