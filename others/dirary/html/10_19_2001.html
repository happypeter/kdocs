<h3>10_19_2001 I run along Minxin River</h3>
<p>This noon, I run along Minxin River by bike on my way back to school from my cusion's. The river bank is made of stone.
It looked clean and tidy. So I sat down on one stone to eat my lunch, which worth 1RMB</p>

<p>There were many willows on both side of the river. Though autumn was here, the leaves were still lovely green.
Water in the river looked clear and a little green, waving with slight wind.</p>
<p>I could see a samll bridge far awaylll,  and a artificial hill was even further under the sky. Every thing was silent
Wind was blowing lightly, water sliding slowly.</p>
<p>Suddenly, a strange feeling comes to me, I love this quite place, because I am a quite boy. Nothing now seemed to be important
Anyway, without my dream I had nothing.</p>
