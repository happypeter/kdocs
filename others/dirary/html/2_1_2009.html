<h3>2_1_2008 Letter to Ruth</h3>
<p>Hello Ruth,</p>

<p>I am sure you've forgotten me, but I bet you still remember your trip in Beijing 2 years ago.
We met each other when you finished your presentation in NCEPU. I am a graduate students there
who asked many questions about life in Swansea. Your helpfulness and smile makes you unforgettable.</p>
<p>
I still remember when we were about to part, you gave me your card and I said I would email you.
But God it is 2 years ago! Sorry, but  a promise is a promise, you see I am man of word.
</p>
<p>
It does not matter whether you remember me or not, anyway I believe It will be nice to have a new old friend
in Beijing:-) Whenever you need  my help, I will be more then willing to offer my hand.
</p>
<p>
I will graduate from NCEPU soon and now am hunting for a job. I want to be a  scholar in the future and will be very happy if a chance is given to study abroad. For the time being unfortunately, I need to work and make money first.
</p>
<p>
In the attached file, it is my CV, you might find something interesting there. Thanks!
</p>
<p>
Yours<br>
Peter
