<h3>10_15_2001 Because I will practise more English</h3>

<p>I use this book. I'd like to fill this notebook with English words. Whatever I want to say, will be write down
in this notebook. How great I am! </p>
<p>I think I am a guy with so much imagination, so I can do this job. Is it a good idea? I am not sure. Maybe this abrupt move will 
do more harm than good to my English study. Because of my poor skills, I will make lots of mistakes. If these mistakes can't be corrected
, my English will not improve. 
</p>
<p>But I will try my best, I will not write down words that are not thought of. Try my best to let my sentences be right. It's better to 
wirte down nothing than something wrong</p>
<p>Maybe in the future, I will memorize some good poem, articles and songs, I can write down them here as well. The new words and phrases 
will increse day by day. I think I can master the spirit of English. Then I can learn English easily, just like a baby. Where this is a will there is a way!</p>
