my blog howto

1. to make the text tidy, copy it to notebook before publish it on net.

   that way, all the words are of the same size.

2. on space after the serial number "1. ddd"
 
3. since i have two blogs, how can i keep them be the same all the time.
 
  of course i can not change one blog artical then go the another blog
 
  to change the same artical at once every time. that is a waste of time.
 
  so what is the better idea?
 
  i guess i can do it this way, 
 
  i give every artical a version number(by adding v1 or v2 to the end of the
 
  name), that way, i can change articals in one blog at will, and have the other
 
  one changed all in one time. 
 
4. today, when i wanted to burn my curve_project onto a disk, i wrote a README
 
   in /doc/, which said: see more in my blog/arm_curve/
 
   however this is not the right way to do it, what is right is to write a README
 
   in myblog/arm_curve/, and say: the project files is in my disks/NO.x/xxx
 
   you see my point? my blog shall be the kernel of my backup system, which in
 
   charge of the backups in the disks, as well as these in printed books.
 
5. that is because when the lists of disks and books gets very long, they are
   actually quite confusing, so the better way is leave a reference mark in my
 
   blog articals, e.g see more about this in my books/NO.xxx/Pxxx~Pxxx
