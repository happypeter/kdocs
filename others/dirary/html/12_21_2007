I cannot phone you now so I hope you still use this email address.  How are you!?!?  I miss you and Billie so much!  I am going to South Africa over the Spring Festival holidays!  I am so happy to see my family again. 

Is it possible to get me some information for computer parts etcetera?  We can do some business here!  There is a big market for Chinese products in South Africa.  Please ask about shipping too.
 
How is your Mama and Baba and the rest of the family? Have you heard from Roy lately?  I got an email from him in September and he said that he was divorced and that he now had a Chinese girlfriend in Taiwan and that they were getting a new 3 bedroomed apartment and he offered Alex and I a place to stay and promised to help us get jobs in Taiwan.  That was the last time I heard from him although I have sent many emails to him since then.  I so would like to get Chen's email address and telephone number in Tanzania but I don't think that will happen.  He sounded so happy but when Roy is silent then things are not going well for him.  I wish I knew how is is!  Can you try and send an email? 
 
Please let me know as soon as possible.

Lots of love
 
Mariann
