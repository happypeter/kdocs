<h3>10_2_2004 Golden Autumn</h3>
<p>
How long must I wait<br>
Before I can find medicine to cure my sorrow<br>
Be it this world or elsewhere<br>
I can never stop the eagerness<br>
Of hewing out the mountain of sadness<br>
A stone of happiness
</p>
<p>
Golden autumn shining and cold wind runing<br>
I can not remember when all these started<br>
And wonder where will they end<br>
Anny, love now seems to be a big illusion<br>
Let's try to forget<br>
But Golden leaves flying and why can't I stop crying<br>
If you built me up and have to tear me down<br>
Then tell me who brought you here<br>
And why are you gone<br>
</p>
