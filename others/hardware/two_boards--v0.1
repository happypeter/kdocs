1. one is for Tomboy, the other with ethernet and SD card is mine
2. firstly, i connect the core board onto tomboy board, the vivi stops
   in the middle of its starting process, i means only part of the message
  
   shows up in hyperterm, then it stops! However, i finally find out that
   there is nothing wrong with vivi or my max3232, the bug is on the 144P
   connector. when you press the middle of its pins with your finger,
   everything works out perfectly!
3. then i turn to my board
   the screen works, as well as the ts. just make sure the jump wire is
   used to connect it to 3.3v power supply rather then 5V
