<h2>Tech experience</h2>
<h3>NO.1 Kernel Hacking</h3>
Being awesomely big and compilcated, Linux kernel is still a mysterious galaxy to me,
even though I have spent more than one year wondering here and there through the guide of 
<i>Understanding Linux Kernel</i>.
 What I actully achieved a little is device driver writing based on 2.6 kernel for Samsung s3c2410 ARM chip. Registers, bitwise manipulations, protocals and oops... a bit too heavy for grils quite frankly.
<br>
<br>
However, the painstaking effort in kernel has taught me the story from the very bottom. 
It was so much fun, when the registers on s3c2410 Manual were wrapped inside my own ioctl(), 
and I was able to insmod my pluggable module and call my home-brew systerm call inside my own Qt GUI program.
<h3>NO.2 Qt Programming</h3>
Strange thing is that I love Qt more than Gtk, even though I prefer Gnome over KDE.
Qt3 is used when I first learned GUI programming, but Qt4 is now prefered because all its nice new
 feathers and the easier portation to embedded platforms.
<br>
Rumor has it Nokia is switching to Qt as it main framework for maemo OS.

<h3>NO.3 Systerm Administration</h3>
I love Ubuntu and use it as my day-to-day desktop
<br>
Synaptic+APT+dpkg works well for me to keep my OS sound.
<br>
When I do development, I use Redhat series including Fedora and 
<br>
Packagekit+YUM+RPM is the set of tools used to keep my software well organized.
<br>
<br>
I would like to develop my own front-end software for system updaters with Qt in the future.
<h2>Books I love:</h2>
