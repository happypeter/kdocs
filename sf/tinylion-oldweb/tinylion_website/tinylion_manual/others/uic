UIC
 there is a
/arm-qtopia/hello/     (a simple pro with .ui file)
that i can not compile directly
so i delet its Makefile
#tmake -o Makefile hello.pro
then i #vi Makefile and find that
-lqtopia is still here.
that means pro file can affect a Makefile in many ways
so i
#rm hello.pro
#progen -n hello -o hello.pro
#tmake -o Makefile hello.pro
now only -lqte and =lm shows up in my Makefile
#make
error: in main.cpp, no <qtopia/qpeapplication.h>
so i change it into <qappkication.h>
#make
error: function showMainWidget() not found
so i change it into
setMainWidget(&f);
f.show();
then
#make
and the final hello runs on arm well
***************
so  i strongly believe if i write a hello with the big qt designer
i can compile it and run it. i will try.
#init 5
now all my envs lost
but, if i want uic and moc, so
#export QTDIR=/arm-qtopia/qt/
for tmake and progen
#export TMAKEDIR=/arm-qtopia/tmake
#export TMAKPATH=$TMAKEDIR/lib/qws/linux-arm-g++
#export PATH=$TMAKEDIR/bin:$PATH
for cross complifier
#export PATH=/usr/local/arm/3.3.2/bin:$PATH
but
but
if you want to compile the big ui pro, you need to
#cp /usr/lib/qt-3.1/bin/uic /arm-qtopia/qt/bin/
big uic for the big ui, haha,easy
then the programme runs on arm
