kernel_compile_change_logo(see mydisks/15.qtopia_hello_project/logo_ncepu)
************
i want the linux logo pic changed,
and it is not easy as it seems.
/************************

*************************/
fblogo-0.5.2.tar.gz
http://download.chinaunix.net/download.php?id=5418&ResourceID=2918
#tar ..
#cd ...
#arm-linux-gcc -v
3.4.1   //in redhat 9
#make
then a executable file named fblogo shows up
i copy linux_logo.png to this dir
#./fblogo linux_logo.png linux_logo.h
error
only palette png is supported.
/************************

*************************/

now, i suddenly find people say, linux has its own tools to do this.
you do not have to use fblogo.
with these people guiding me
#cd s3c2410-linux-2.6.11/drivers/video/logo
#rm logo_linux_clut224.ppm(as well as .c and .o)
#mv logo_linux_clut224.ppm.old logo_linux_clut224.ppm
//since i do not know how to make a .pnm file myself, the old one is used
then i
#cd /s3c2410-linux-2.6.11
#make mrproper
since i am going to recompile the kernel
so i want to do it as the kernel README tells me
but error
.../.../arch can not be removed, it is a directory..
now i start to realize, this kernel is not a mainline one
it is changed
so i just
#make zImage
then a few messages show up
and one or two minuites later
i am told zImage is ready
stupid as i am, i still know
a common kernel build process takes much longer
but something about logo_linux_clut224 is seen,
so i want to move to zImage on arm and see what happens
luckly the logo is changed, the yctek logo diappears
and a little penguin is there!
now changing a logo is easy to me, all it takes is to
*****************************************************
#  remove the .pnm file
#  .......the  .c  file
#  .............o  file
#  change the name of another .pnm file into
#  logo_linux_clut224.ppm
#  then make zImage(at least it works on yctek-kernel)
*****************************************************
now the new question is
how can i change my own pic into a qualified pnm file?
it is as easy as below
******************
# pngtopnm linuxlogo.png > linuxlogo.pnm
# pnmquant 224 linuxlogo.pnm > linuxlogo224.pnm
# pnmtoplainpnm linuxlogo224.pnm > linuxlogo224.ppm
*******************
thanks to internet!
i shall mention that the kernel Make file is so smart
that when just now i made a ppm file in wrong format
the Makefiles detected it! cool!
**
but the above requires, a qualified png file.
but how to make a pic into the required png file?
that is a question.
note: the size of the png file shall be 320x240,
otherwise, it will not fit the screen well
so i
just open the right png file(from kernel source), open it
with windows painting software, copy the image i want then
paste it onto the one from kernel, then save it.
it is simple.
and finally i see 'ncepu' as a bootlogo on arm.
*****************
the s3c2410-2.6.11 kernel(yctek kernel) Makefile is clever
when you
#make zImage
it will find out which part of the kernel is changed
and recompile only this part
so i am free to change the kernel now
either by
#make menuconfig
or
#vi xxx.c
after that
#make zImage
so easy.
