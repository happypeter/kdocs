Creating Multple Repositories


===ssh is definately what i must have
https://sourceforge.net/apps/trac/sourceforge/wiki/Shell service

all I need to do is

ssh -t USER,PROJECT@shell.sourceforge.net create
so in my case, it is
ssh -t happypeter, tinylion@shell.sourceforge.net create

easy but very slow.
