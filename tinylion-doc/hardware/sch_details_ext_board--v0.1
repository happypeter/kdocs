1. Audio
 
cause I already have avdd in power.sch,
so I delete the avdd here. And change all 10uF/10V to 10uF/16V.
note the polar of all the electro cap.
 
2. Ethernet
 
Note, the 74HC14 here seems to be the same one in Jtag.sch
No! they are not!
 
3. Jtatg
 
as I see it, 8 pins are enough to perform a jtag protocal,
I will make it a ten pins connector
 
4. LCD&TS
 
the 1,2 pins of lcd interface can be connect to either 3.3 or 5 V,
on qirui’s board they use a jump wire and choose 5V,
I will use a jump wire here too.
on sis_board, the folling pins are connected to four vias,
but the vias have no further connection.
 
2410pinNUM Nets on coreB realcoreNUM   
P11 XMON B53   
U11 NXPON B54   
T11 YMON B55   
M11 nYPON B56 
 
the core board has pins out for
vd0,vd1(L2), vd2()
but in siterboard,
they are not connected
(in the sch file they are connected to GND,
 
but have a look at the pcb(netlabel vd0),
you will see they are up in the air)
when I do want to draw the lcd.sch
I will use the yctek net labels,
I will need to change my realcore.sch a little.
on sis_board all the vd pins are connected to risisters first,
then the out nvv are connect to lcd connected to lcd connector,
is that the same in yctek sch? NO, yctek connects cpu and lcd connector directly.
there is a error in sis real core.sch lib , A52 is not OM0, but VD8.
in the core board pcb, AIN4(R15) and AIN6(R16) are not connected,
thus in bottom board net labels of the two is not found.
Meanwhile, AIN5 AND 7 is not connected in the buttom board,
so does that mean there is no touch screen support in sister’s board?
Yes, yctek touch screen connect has 41 lines,
with its TSXP and TSYP connected to AIN5 anf 7,
while sister board connecter has only 33 pins,
with less data line and no YSXP and TXYP is available.
I want ture color TFT and ts support in my own design,
which sister board does not have. But that is not difficult,
I can get the footprint from qirui’s lib,
and connect it as yctek .sch file tell me.
acorrding to 2410UM p411, AIN5 and 7
are used to receive touch screen’s x and y position signal,
now that sister board ani5 and 7 are not connected,
so I can conclude that the ts is not supported.
And maybe true color is not supported either, cause less vd lines are uesed here.
in yctek sch pin 31 32 of lcd connector is not connected, so is mine.
sister core board does not support true color. VD16, 17, 18, is not available.!!!!!
 
5. Power supply
 
a) because I want to use ts,
   so AVDD is needed,
   that means I have to use part of yctek power supply sch.
 
b) In 2410UM: VDDalive P S3C2410X reset block
   and port status register VDD(1.8V).
   It should be always supplied whether in normal mode or in power-off mode.
 
c) just connect it to VCC18 as sister does.
   But that way the pwren signal from CPU, is of no use.
   Yctek method has its advantages.!
 
d) The power supply interface,
   I will make one like yctek: 5v usb small round.
 
6. Uart
 
a) they say RS485 protocol is better.
   But in 2410UM, they do not metion 485 at all!
 
b) pepole say many PCs do not support 485,
   so I will choose 232 finally in my design.
   Anyway it working very well now.
   Not broken, not need to fix!
 
c) parallel (rather than cross) wire is
   right for the uart connection of sister board and yctek board.
 
d) note: the serial wire I bought is cross
   which is right for the uart connection of sister board.
   The yctek one is a parallel wire.
 
e) test succeed! Three pins are enough.
 
f) want to keep the wire lines tidy,
   simply make my own CON3_1 to be GND,
   and make 2 be sister 2, 3 be sister board 3.
   that way the three lines do not need to cross,
   when you connect the three lines out of your board
   and connect them to a female connector
   (the femal is to be pluged in the yctek male )
