ethernet cables<br>
<OL>
	<LI>i have been suspecting whether my YCtek cable is the same as the cable<br>
   we are using to connect PC with harbor. they look as if they are different<br>
   and maybe they are turely different. however, what i know for sure now is<br>
   i can use the YCtek cable to connect PC with harbor. meanwhile, i can use<br>
   Lab cable to setup NFS connection between YCtek arm and PC. ALL works perfectly!<br>
	<LI>and when i connect PC and sister board with the lab cable, the two LEDS shine as<br>
   if they are working, i am not sure about this because there is no core board on sister<br>
   board now.<br>
	<LI>anyway, i now believe i can use lab cable wherever as i can use YCtek cable.<br>
	<LI>now i want to know whether the broken RJ45 works the same way as<br>
   the sister board RJ45, if they are the same that means i do not need<br>
   to take my board to Erbozi agian.<br>
   // so i plug one end of lab cable in to RJ45 on my board<br>

so i test the connection relation ship between then<br>
the result is as below<br>
a--8<br>
b--4<br>
c--7<br>
d--e--6--3<br>
f--2<br>
g--5<br>
h--1<br>
note: the result above if of my broken RJ45<br>
now its naturely to test the rerlationship of sister board<br>
 
and here is the rusult<br>
// the Lab cable itself is a perfect prellal cable, to be exact<br>
// a--a b--b ...(in Picure B)<br>
but the YCtek cable is quite different<br>
a--c<br>
b--f<br>
c--a<br>
d--d<br>
e--e<br>
f--b<br>
g--g<br>
h--h <br>   
****************************************<br>
finally, everything is clear when the pcb file is opened.<br>
my circuit is the same as sister's.<br>
now we concentrade on RD+ and RD-<br>
on both sister and YCtek board, the two are connected even<br>
there is no power supply for arm.<br>
but on my board they are not! (the same is ture of TD+ TD-)<br>
now that the circuit is right. so there are two possiblities left:<br>
a) the chip is not well mounted<br>
b) the chip is broken<br>
if the chip is not broken, the RD+ and RD- is of one, as it is ture<br>
on the sister board.<br>
but the chip on my board is not connected<br>
so that means the chip itself is broken.<br>
note there is no power supply when i test it.<br>

ethernet hardware error<br>
<OL>
<LI>when i connect PC and arm, PC port light shines, which means<br>
   it finds out a connection. but the leds on arm have no reaction.
<LI>ping PC the error:<br>
   buffer not free!<br>
   that means the hardware connection is not set up.
<LI>i change my arm cable into the PC cable, but that makes no difference!
<LI>the votage of the two leds are (3.2-1.65), that is ture of both my board<br>
   and sister board, which makes me believe my cs8900 is also working properly<br>
   but, when connected with PC through the cable, the ever-bright led on sister<br>
   board holds a voltage (3.2-0.06)v, but my led remain the same as the state<br>
   when there is no connection. So maybe only the port RJ45 is responsiblle for<br>
   all my trouble.
<LI>i will but another 144P, and let the workers fix the sister board for me.
