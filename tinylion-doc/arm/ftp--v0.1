1.on pc linux:

#service  vsftpd  restart  /*both redhat9 and f7 will react, I test and succeed. */

#ifconfig eth0 192.168.1.6

#cp hello /home/peter

1.then on your target board:

#cd /bin 

#ftp  192.168.1.6 (make sure your target board’s own if is 192.168.1.x now)

>name:peter

>passwd: 111111 

/*then all files in /home/peter are there for you*/

>get  hello

>bye

#chmod  a+x  hello

then you can see hello at /bin on ARM

------------------------------------------------------------------------

- I try it in f7 and succeed, as long as there is a commom user named peter, nothing else is necessary. But it does work very well, you can transfer peter.c but not peter.ko. I don’t know why.

 see more in /etc/vsftpd/vsftpd.conf

the use of hyperterminal

choose transfer|transfer file|zmodem, you get your file tranfered to ARM, so handy.
