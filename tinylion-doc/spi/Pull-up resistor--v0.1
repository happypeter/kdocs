http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pull-up_resistor

i digital circuit, i believe ip the pullup of a pin is enabled, it means:
1. when there is no signal, the output of this pin is logic high
2. if the input is not strong enough, the pullup resister can supply the required power to guarantee the pin voltage is high enough
