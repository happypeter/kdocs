now if I
/usr/share/axtu-authen-client/bin/axtu-authen-client-cui
I get this:

 -t, --tk-path=STRING            follow with file path for temporary-key
  -a, --address-path=STRING       follow with file path for repository
                                  addresses
  -i, --id=STRING                 follow with Your member Id
  -p, --password=STRING           follow with Your password for member ID
  -n, --product-number=STRING     follow with your product number
  -s, --system-name=STRING        follow with your system name
  -d, --disable-collect-info      You may not allow sending the system

so the command line program has no UI, I need to add one for yum auth

===
I can call authen-client in yum plugin init_hook()
so when authen-client obtain or update aktk
I can add some other code to modify the baseurl that yum use(to add id and passwd into the url)
then auth is done.haha

===

[root@dhcp17 ~]# /usr/share/axtu-authen-client/bin/axtu-authen-client-cui -i user3 -p abc123 -n 203K4-40Q00-0000N-383LN-MGN2Q
[Authentication Error] Don't match your Authentication Key.
[root@dhcp17 ~]#

so I use gui and obtain a right ak, now:

[root@dhcp17 ~]# /usr/share/axtu-authen-client/bin/axtu-authen-client-cui -i user3 -p abc123 -n 203K4-40Q00-0000N-383LN-MGN2Q
AK is Already existed
[root@dhcp17 ~]#          

luckily I can

[root@dhcp17 ~]# /usr/share/axtu-authen-client/bin/axtu-authen-client-cui -r
Your authentication key file is removed
[root@dhcp17 ~]#    

now it is OK:

[root@dhcp17 ~]# /usr/share/axtu-authen-client/bin/axtu-authen-client-cui -i user3 -p abc123 -n 203T5-44QG2-0000N-383LN-MGN2Q
Successfully the authentication key is created.
[root@dhcp17 ~]# axtu

authentification done perfectly, just like gui is in use

one small nice tip here:

[root@dhcp17 ~]# /usr/share/axtu-authen-client/bin/axtu-authen-client-cui -r
Your authentication key file is removed
[root@dhcp17 ~]# /usr/share/axtu-authen-client/bin/axtu-authen-client-cui -r
Your authentication key file is removed
[root@dhcp17 ~]# /usr/share/axtu-authen-client/bin/axtu-authen-client-cui -r
Your authentication key file is removed

the above means, I do not write in my plugin if(ak is there) then '-r', I can just run '-r'
even there is no ak on systerm. and if there is a wrong ak, it is obvious that we should use '-r'
and the little not-so-nice thing is that what if there is a right ak on system?
so maybe I shall still detect if ak is there or not then the logic is much clearer.
