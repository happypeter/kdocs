now if I
/usr/share/axtu-authen-client/bin/axtu-authen-client-cui
I get this:

 -t, --tk-path=STRING            follow with file path for temporary-key
  -a, --address-path=STRING       follow with file path for repository
                                  addresses
  -i, --id=STRING                 follow with Your member Id
  -p, --password=STRING           follow with Your password for member ID
  -n, --product-number=STRING     follow with your product number
  -s, --system-name=STRING        follow with your system name
  -d, --disable-collect-info      You may not allow sending the system

so the command line program has no UI, I need to add one for yum auth

===
I can call authen-client in yum plugin init_hook()
so when authen-client obtain or update aktk
I can add some other code to modify the baseurl that yum use(to add id and passwd into the url)
then auth is done.haha
