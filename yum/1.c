[Note]	Plugin Installed by Default

Fedora Core includes the installonlyn plugin. This plugin modifies yum to remove excess kernel packages, so that no more than a set number of kernels exist on the system. By default, installonlyn retains the two most current kernels, and automatically removes older kernel packages.
