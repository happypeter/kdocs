refer to https://help.ubuntu.com/community/DocBook

1.First I install the following packages(using apt-get install xxx):


- docbook (maybe this step is not needed)
- xsltproc (the XSL Transformations Processor)
- docbook-xsl (stylesheets for HTML, XHTML, HTML Help and others)
- docbook-defguide (The Definitive Guide to DocBook - recommended)

2. then the file test.xml and the following command
 xsltproc -o test.html /usr/share/xml/docbook/stylesheet/nwalsh/xhtml/docbook.xsl test.xml

3. the use of Makefile is easy

4. now I want to use fop to generate PDF file, but fop is java-based, so I need
   to install java first 

   $apt-get install sun-java6-bin

well, fop is not working!
