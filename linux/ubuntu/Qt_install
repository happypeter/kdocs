/******************qt/e ------x86->fb****************************/
See the INSTALL file in the package first

./configure -qvfb
 make

# qvfb
The program 'qvfb' is currently not installed.  You can install it by typing:
apt-get install qt3-dev-tools-embedded
so i run
$apt-get install qt3-dev-tools-embedded
Now I have my ubuntu qvfb
the qvfb runs well, but the problem is there is no /dev/fb0 in ubuntu8.04

Hi,

I had this problem that qt/e applications couldn't be run within qvfb because 
of missing QVFb drivers.

The webpage says to configure qt/e with -qvfb. This is a configure option of 
qt/e 2.x

New qt/e-versions have to be compiled with

-qt-gfx-qvfb

This option is not clearly printed in the help-page of configure.

I'm posting this here, because I had myself a hard time to figure this out.

***************
when I run
$./configure -h
and find out the above letter does make sense, as I don't have /dev/fb0 in ubuntu
                        -qt-gfx-<driver> ... Enable a graphics <driver> in the QtGui library.
                         Possible values for <driver>: [ linuxfb transformed qvfb vnc multiscreen ]

so I 
./configure -qt-gfx-qvfb

well, still the fb0 error.

so I use VNC http://doc.trolltech.com/4.4/qt-embedded-vnc.html

/********************qt/e-------arm*************************/
See the INSTALL file in the package first
You need to install arm-linux-gcc first.
./configure -embedded arm          (MAYBE SOME MORE ARGUMENT GO HERE FOR THE SUPPORT OF TS OR MOUSE)
./make

I use arm-linux-gcc-3.4.1------------everything is done.
But maybe I shall use 3.3.2 to compile it again if i want to mv examples to ARM
to get rid of clib compatibility issue.
