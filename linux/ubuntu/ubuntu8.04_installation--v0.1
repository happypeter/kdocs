ubuntu8.04_installation
i download the OS iso file from a Taiwan website
burn it into a disk(a DVD, eventhogh a vcd will do)
insert the CD and reboot my PC
then a beautiful picture shows up with a dialog on it says
whether do you want to install the OS
you have to choose cancle here otherwise your installation may fail
i myself failed three times this way
anyway you cancle here and then a desktop(rather then a mere pic) shows up
you double click the icon here to start the installation.
During the disk partion. Ext3 is prefered as the FS.
all you need are a swap and a / partion
