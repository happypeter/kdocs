Ask not what Openoffice can do, ask what it can not do!

1. Getting PDF

These guys have been doing quite a lot to fight against MS office.

If you want a PDF file, you choose 'file-.print/export as PDF' and it will be done nicely for you.

This also works for firefox.

2.Getting HTML

Since I do not know CSS, so it is difficult for me to make nice looking html pages. Now all I need to do crate a html file

and copy it to my web pages' html editor. (choose firefox->view->page source to obtain the source code)
