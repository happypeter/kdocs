go the axtu-debug/ and see what a mess there!!!
I need rules to devide all stuff here into distingushed parts, and yet well keep their connection.
too much disorgnized contents, why is this?

1. I hate bug-reports, they are always misleading and useless, but here I am now forced to work this way, so I need to mv someaxtu-debug content into bugzilla discussion, and backup my own bugs, and all the sds diff for each IP I sent. How comes I need to backupbugzilla and sds? it's the work of the company, but those guys are not smart enough to keep my data safe.
2. biggest trouble is from sds&svn, I hate them with all my passion. I can not wirte commit log, how rediculous! But anyway I have git now, so big part of axtu-debug can go into git log and source code comments. comments are really important for me, but I won't commit them into svn. My git repo will be the final authrity for axtu development
3. I really need to change the way I take debug notes, otherwise things will get undercontrol getting bigger.

>>> some conclutions are really useful for later development, I will copy(maybe mv is better, since it is always stupid to maintain two copy of the same thing) it to doc-axtu/, such as HOW_AXTU_USE_AK and AXTU_GUI_WORK_FLOW, and this also means we do not need peki/study/axtu/ anymore.
