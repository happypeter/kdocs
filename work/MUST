Hi All,

I think some of you already know about this.
But let me send this out for confirmation and for new developer.

1. When a bug assigned to you and you started to work on it.
   You have to change the status of bug to 'RECEIVED'.
   Then other people can know you are investigating the bug.
   And SDS cannot change its status to FIXED when IP has been closed.

2. Send IP.
   SDS will change the status of bug to FIXED when you closed IP.
   You have to be sure you have changed the status to RECEIVED before
   sending IP, or SDS cannot change the status to FIXED automatically.

3. Status of bug will be changed to INTEGRATED automatically.
   I run a script every week. The script will make a list of bugs which
   have been fixed in specified period. And I'll give the list to testers.
   They will start to verify our fix without waiting new ISO release.
   But the script cannot take care of some bugs such as new package,
   non-RECEIVED bug before closing IP.
   I'll inform you such bugs. You have to confirm if the fix exists
   and you have to leave a comment immediately. If you delay it, it 
   influence testers schedule.

4. At new ISO is going to be released.
   The status of bugs would be INTEGRATED by 3 at new ISO release.
   But developer have to confirm if the ISO includes your fix or not.
   You have to leave a comment on each bugs which you owned to make sure
   about it.

If you don't change the bug status to RECEIVED, you have to do from 2
to 4 by yourself. And it might have impact on the schedule.
So please be careful about it. We have some bugs whose status is still
NEW or REOPENED.

Thanks,
-Jun
