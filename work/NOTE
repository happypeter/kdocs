NOTE

when Jun apprival my IP, I need to login SDS  to change it status to "closed".
And after the svn merge, I need close the bugs and check if the change is really integrated in the new ISO, but how?
ANSWER:Wait for the Email from Jun. Check the number "?" in "axtu...-?AX".

>>>when you change the IP
1. check file again to regenerate spec.diff
2. add postfix to attached img file(like .png)

>>>
be sure to build the package brfore sending IP
note the name "axtu" or "axtu-authen-client" in 
$sudo  /project/bin/axbldpkg -j Quartet-sp2  -V 3.0  -w ~/sds/ -t /home/peter/tmp/    axtu
