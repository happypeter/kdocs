Widget

1. Downloaded here http://doc.trolltech.com/3.1/aclock-example.html, the three files was put in a folder named peter,

2. qmake â€“project->qmake->make, in one of the three files I add #endif, then complation completed.

3. in main.cpp, aclock.h is included, but I think it should be aclock.cpp, because aclock includes a.h, but itself is not referred in main! How can it be so?

4. finished adding your custom widget, you can not only see it in tools|custom, but also in tool bar area on the top of the main window, after choosing window|toolbar|cutom

5. Note: when you add a custom widget, the dilog require two items: the Class name(it is in the .h file), and the .h file

////////////////

how to use it in Designer
1. do everything in the help file

2. generate a form1.ui using designer, insert the widget. it is ok that the analog.h file is in another file.

3. never use the Designer_generated .pro file, run qmake -project
        yourself.
