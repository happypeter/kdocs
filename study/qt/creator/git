welcome->A quick tour->Qt Creator and Version Control Systems
open a git project by clicking the .pro file, then 
tools->git->show commit
requires the hash valule, and i have to use "bash>git log" to get the hash, how rediculous!
so for me, the better solution is:
open my git projects in creator, add ui files or whatever
but do not use the creators ui for git, stick to my command line
