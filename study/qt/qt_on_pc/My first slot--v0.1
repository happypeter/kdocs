My first slot

1. open qt designer, save simple.pro in /root/simple/, then add a form1, and add a slot named peter() to it, drag a push button, connect its signal click() to form1’s slot peter(), save both,

2. #cd /root/simple/ #qmake #make, #./simple, then a stupid form with only one button shows up, push the button, you see “peter() is not impleted” in xterm

3. go back to the designer, double click form1 to edit form1.ui.h, you see a function form1::peter(){  }, add #include <iostream.h> above it, and cout<<”hello peter/n” in the braces.

4. save and make again, finally hello peter shows up in xterm everytime the button is clicked.

/////////////////////////////--------------

1. fisrt thing from here is to figure out how to output in the form rather then merely xterm

2. in the ui.h file, I add void Form1::init() { cout<<”I am initialized!”}, save and complie, there is a error “expected ; before }”, add the ;, then everything turn out to be what I expected.

3. now I put a lineEdit1 into the form (the name lineEdit1 is very inportant, it should remain exactly the same everyplace it is referred), and the ui.h now looks:

int j;

void Form1::peter()

{

j++;

lineEdit1->setText(Qs(S is in upper case J)tring::number(j));/*I learn this function from designer|help|quickstart*/

}

 

void Form1::init()

{

lineEdit1->setText(“1”);

}

4. so finally, everytime the button is clisked, the number in the lineedit increases by 1;

5. note: No need to add #include<XXX.ui.h> or <qlineedit.h>anywhere
