Qt designer usage

1. want to open property editor? Click window|view|

2. any tool window like toolbox, your custom widget, and everything can be seen, you can add and remove them by select or deselct item in window|

3. there files generated form qt designer in the folder named peter: peter.pro,form1.ui, main.cpp

4. I delete peter.pro, and make my own one using qmake, compilation succeed.

the main need from1.h, which is generated during qmake, form1.h is same as uic form1.ui, however, even you have form1.h, the absence of form1.ui will definitely lead to a compilation failure.
