tslib-1.3
http://bbs.chinaunix.net/thread-1035999-1-1.html
know more about tslib in
/tslib.x.x/README
************
they say if you want a libqte.so with ts support
you need to
#vi /qt/configs/linux-arm-g++-shared
and
SYSCONF_LIBS=-lm -lts
**
people on line say you may need to chage
qt/src/kernel/qwsmouse_qws.cpp
to adjust the ts-data to satisfy the mouse need.
***********
**********
so anyway i need to compile tslib first
#tar...#cd...#./autogen.sh
then error
people say that is because libtool is not properly installed
others say that is because the "PREFIX" if automake and libtool
are not the same, which reslut in that the libtool is not found.
they say the solution is reinstall libtool to its default position
**
so i download libtool.tar from GNU website.
ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/libtool/
and according to its /doc/INSTALL, the default position is /usr/local/bin
#tar...#cd...#./configure
then a date error shows up
#date -s 20080607
the error is gone, following by another one:
can not...C complified programmes
so i
#export CC=arm-linux-gcc
#./configure --host=arm-linux
#make
#make install
all above are executed, then i
#ls /usr/local/bin
and see
libtool libtoolize
#file libtool
bash script text executable(the same is true for libtoolize)
#./libtool
libtool error: you must specify a MODE
**
that means they are not for arm only, that's good.
but what is the point to export CC=arm-linux-gcc???
*****
#cd tslib-1.0
#./autogen.sh
now the error is different:
autoconf version 2.58 or higher is required.
maybe it is becaue the version of libtool i just install is the latest
delete libtool in /usr/local/bin, the error is different, that means
my libtool works!
then i
#cd tslib-1.3
#./autogen.sh
#./configure --host=arm-linux-gcc
#make
error:
this is libtool-2.2.4(my own libtool)....but...the macro..
so it is clear now my libtool works, the trouble it is too new.
during the 1.3 compilation a libtool is generated, and it must be
of the right version, so i override my own libtool with it.
but no libtoolize is seen. then i ./configure again
and in error message, the libtool version is still 2.2.4,
i know this is my libtoolize working now.
so what is the right libtool version.
*******************
the libtool version is 1.0(oldest one :))
#./configure
#make
#make install
succeed without "CC" and "--host=arm-linux-gcc"
#cd tslib--1.0
#export CC=arm-linux-gcc
#./autogen.sh
error
libtoolize:'configure.in' does not exists.
*********
in tslib-1.3/ltmain
i find the right libtool version number is 1.4.3
so i install 1.4.3 to /usr/local/bin
#cd tslib-1.0
#libtool --version
1.4.3
#./autogen.sh
error: undefined macro: AS_HELP_STRING
people say install libtool in the default way is just for this error!!
so i
#cd tslib-1.3
#export CC=arm-linux-gcc
#./autogen.sh
#./configure --host=arm-linux
then a message shows up saying i should not use 'host'
so i issue
#./configure
i am not sure which ./confiure works
#make
then
#ls -a src
and i see what i want .lib/
God, it is not easy.
************
************
now i want do it all again
so i restiore snapshot
************
********
#arm-linux-gcc -v
3.3.2
#cd libtool-1.4.3
#./configure
error:check your sys clock
#date -s 20080607
#./configure
#make
#make install
#ls /usr/local/bin
libtool libtoolize
#libtool --version
1.4.3
//so libtool is installed now
#cd tslib-1.3
#export CC=arm-linux-gcc
#./autogen.sh
then some like a error shows up:
you should add the conten of '../.../..../libtool.m4' to 'aclocal.m4'
but i let it be
#./configure --host=arm-linux
then 'do not use --host' flashes and disappers in a second
but i do not care
#make
compilation terminates.
