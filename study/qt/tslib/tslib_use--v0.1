see tslib_compile first
**********
now that i have the tslib in my hands
i can preceed.
#cp src/.libs/* /arm-qtopia/qt/lib
#cp plugins/.lib/*.so /arm-qtopia/qt/lib
#cp src/*.h /arm-qtopia/qt/include
**
ok, now i am ready to compile a lqte with touch screen support
#echo $QTDIR
/arm-qtopia/qt
#export PATH=$QTDIR/bin:$PATH //for moc
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$QTDIR/lib:$LD....//to export the lib files
////////////////////////////
//people say they use
//cp $QPEDIR/src/qt/qconfig-qpe.h src/tools
//./configure -qconfigure qpe -xplatform linux-arm-g++ -shared -no-xft
///////////////////////////
//i do not know about that, so i try my way first
#./configure -xplatform linux-arm-g++
#vi src/Makefie
i see the line
SYSCONF_LIBS  =-lm -lts
// i changed qt/configs/linux-arm-g++-shared before,
//add'-lts' to the end of 'SYSCONF_LIBS=-lm -lts'
//thatworks
#make -C src
about 10 miniutes later libqte.so.2.3.7 is seen.
i am very happy, but when i
#mv lib/tslib.so* ../
and
#./configure -xplatform linux-arm-g++
again, libqte.so.2.3.7 is obtained as well.
that is bad, does that mean the generated lqte do not
connected to tslib at all! but there is truly -lts in Makefile.
i even add -ltsssss in the Makefie, but still successful.
now i am confused.
************
i restore a snapshot, in which there is no libts.
add -lts to the Makefile,
still successful.
why is that?
************
*********
now i decide to temporaryly give up compiling qte.so with ts support
i want a hello with ts support
so i
#cd hello
#make
succeed
#vi Makefie //and -lts
#make
error can not find lts
#cp .../libts.0.0.so.x.x /arm=qtopia/qt/lib
#ln lints.0.0.so.x.x libts.so
#cd hello
#make
succeed with ts support
#mv hello hello-ts
then in hyperterm
#chmod a+x hello-ts
#./hello-ts
error: no libts-0.0.so.0
so i copy the needed libts.so
into /lib
and
#ln -s xxxxxxx libts-0.0.so
#./hello-ts
no error
#vi /usr/etc/rc.local
reboot arm
the hello-ts runs, but the screen does not have
even a tiny reaction to my touch on the sreen.
*********
ok, i will continue this topic tomorrow.
************
new day, new luck
**
before activate the ts, i firstly want to eliminate the cursor
so i recompile libqte
#./configure -config qpe -xplatform linux-arm-g++
'-config qpe' means to use configs/config-qpe.h file
but you know what when i substitude the running lqte with this one on arm
reboot and i see only a cursor, that's rediculous!
but i think that maybe its because the hello running is not compiled
against this 'no-cursor-lqte',
so i make a hello-no-cursor, however, when i try to run it on arm
error:
Qsocket is not open,
which mean's somrhting wrong with the libqte.so.
i don't understand about this.

>>>>>>ok, i will go back for this later, for now i will start my FriendlyARM porting project...
