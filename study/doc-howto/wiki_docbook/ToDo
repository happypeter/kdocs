= MoinMoin =

I decide to use monimoni, though it is not easy to convert wiki files to clearly structured html or docbook.
but what I like most is it is so easy to write single page with so beautiful output.

== Keep kdocs/ structure ==
 1. I can simply write docs in moinmoin editor, then save what I write to the right locality under ''kdocs/''
 1. since I use git, so I do not need wiki revision actually

== TODO ==
 1. mv my kdocs pages into wiki format
 1. have a dir herachy the same as the local site map
 1. new Moin is able to creat single page docbook xml, so I believe I can get the docbooks I want by creating a index with links to all pages, or whatever way
 1. now my issue is to figure out how Moin can read out my kdocs/
