= MoinMoin =

I decide to use monimoni, though it is not easy to convert wiki files to clearly structured html or docbook.
but what I like most is it is so easy to write single page with so beautiful output.

== Keep kdocs/ structure ==
I can simply write docs in moinmoin editor, then save what I write to the right locality under ''kdocs/''
since I use git, so I do not need wiki revision actually
