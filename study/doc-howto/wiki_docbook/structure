Now I am quite satified with the easy writing and beautiful output of each page
but the problem is how can I orgnize all these pages

in my kdocs:
/kdocs/             ---------------- book name
/kdocs/doc-axtu     ---------------- chapter name
/kdocs/doc-axtu/xx  ---------------- sec name

so it is obvious fit for the docbook structure well
----
but here we use MoinMoin, and everything is based on wiki,
the wiki structure is too different form my kdocs
e.g
when I am writing a wiki

IndexPage has a link named ChapeterPage that is in turn has a link SecPage inside

but physically we get this
{{{
pet@pet-desktop:~/Desktop/moin-1.8.5/wiki/data/pages$ ls
ChapeterPage  IndexPage  SecPage
pet@pet-desktop:~/Desktop/moin-1.8.5/wiki/data/pages$ 
}}}
while I currently want
{{{
IndexPage/ChapeterPage/SecPage
}}}
good thing here is if you click Action->Local site map
{{{
 IndexPage [view]
      ChapeterPage [view]
           SecPage [view]
}}}
== I am confused ==

but I think when I see how Moin produces a read docbook <book>, then I may understand
A: it seems this is still in progress

{{{
You can generate DocBook for any page with the "Render As DocBook" action. See HelpOnActions. 
}}}
Solution:
I do not need docbook right now, and I believe it can be done.
since I have 
Action->local site map
I need to say it is not bad to just usr wiki to view my docs
