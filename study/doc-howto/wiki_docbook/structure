Now I am quite satified with the easy writing and beautiful output of each page
but the problem is how can I orgnize all these pages

in my kdocs:
/kdocs/             ---------------- book name
/kdocs/doc-axtu     ---------------- chapter name
/kdocs/doc-axtu/xx  ---------------- sec name

so it is obvious fit for the docbook structure well
----
but here we use MoinMoin, and everything is based on wiki,
the wiki structure is too different form my kdocs
e.g
when I am writing a wiki

IndexPage has a link named ChapeterPage that is in turn has a link SecPage inside

but physically we get this
{{{
pet@pet-desktop:~/Desktop/moin-1.8.5/wiki/data/pages$ ls
ChapeterPage  IndexPage  SecPage
pet@pet-desktop:~/Desktop/moin-1.8.5/wiki/data/pages$ 
}}}
while I currently want
{{{
IndexPage/ChapeterPage/SecPage
}}}

== I am confused ==

but I think when I see how Moin produces a read docbook <book>, then I may understand
