I have a dream that one day, I do not need to type same commands over and over
again!

1. I want some gui tool readout my kdocs/
1. I see a index tree, I can esaily navigate
1. when I click a file, it is opened in Moinmoin
1. I mean I can edit the file in GUI or text Mode to do wiki composing
1. I have then a nice wiki output for all pages
1. I want my whole tree, transformed into a docbook <book> in one go
1. maybe I also need to make a subdir of kdocs in to a <book>
1. I want button for git commit
1. since I use git, I do not want wiki revisons
1. it will be nice to add links to another page in a wiki way
1. but I will first gurantee the kdocs tree strucure
1. to garantee fastest navigation
yes, I will wirte docs in wiki format, since wiki means "quick"
yes, I need the output to be cute to speed up my reading
yes, I want it in pdf or html, so that I can share it with anybody
