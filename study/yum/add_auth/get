GET sends the data as part of the URL. For example, suppose you enter the value "West Rochester" in this form below:

add auth is now simple, since we have axtu-auth-client.
AK&&TK are now ready as two files for yum to use.
for axtu they are sent by wget, the code for this is rather complex since it's C. But I do not think I need to concern that, I believe it is auth-server that isrsponsible to open the auth_mysql area. and auth_server simply get AK&&TK via some simple method like GET or POST(maybe crypted).
